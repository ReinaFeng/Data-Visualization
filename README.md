## Data
The [National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nors/) supports outbreak reporting by partners in state, local, and territorial public health agencies.
It includes different types of Outbreaks such as: Food, Water, Animal, Contact, Environmental, Person to Person, Indeterminate/Unknown.

## Prototypes

This bar plot shows the number of outbreaks in different months as well as the distribution of differet types of disease in each month.

## Questions & Tasks
* Does the outbreak have the seasonality? Which months have highest frequency?
* How was the distribution of the outbreaks for each type in America?
* Which is the most serious etiology? Which state most easily has it?

## Sketches
### 1. Time-Series Plot
This plot will show how did the number of outbreaks change by time. User can filter by some categories like "Etology", "State" and "Primary Mode". Ideally, when user click a line, a corresponding bar plot will appear.

### 2. Distribution Map
This plot will show the distribution of the Outbreaks. Darker color means larger number and it supports interactive functions like showing the number and state name.

### 3. Analysis on Primary Mode
This plot will show how the proportion of different Primary Mode with stack bar plot. Ideally, it will be a dynamic plot. The bars may change by time.

* Draw basic lines
* Create menu for selection
* Add interaction: When move mouse on the plot, it will show corresponding values.

### Week2: Distribution Map
* Draw basic map
* Set colors
* Add interaction: When move on a state it will show the corresponding value

### Week3: Analysis on Primary Mode
* Draw pie chart
* Create a menu for selection

### Week4: Solving Problems& Modify
* Solve the problems in the past 3 weeks
* Add interaction on Time-Series Plot: When click a line, a corresponding bar plot will appear
* Modify the pie chart to other fancy charts
* Try to make the Distribution Map and the third plot dynamic
